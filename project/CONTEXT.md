# Project Context

## Overview
This project is a static website for labs.chansteven.com, focusing on a lightweight landing page hosted on GitHub Pages. The website showcases mini-experiments, a blog, and a profile page, with an emphasis on minimal maintenance.

## GitHub Pages Configuration
- The website is configured to use the `docs/` directory as the publishing source for GitHub Pages.
- This is a requirement of GitHub Pages, which only allows publishing from either:
  1. The root directory (`/`) of a specific branch
  2. The `/docs` directory of a specific branch
- All website content must be placed in the `docs/` directory to be published.
- The project documentation and context are kept separate in the `project/` directory to maintain a clean separation between published content and project documentation.

## Project Structure
- `docs/`: Contains the main content of the website (GitHub Pages source).
  - `index.html`: The landing page.
  - `experiments/`: Directory for experiment Markdown files.
  - `thoughts/`: Directory for blog post Markdown files.
  - `profile/`: Directory for profile content.
  - `_layouts/`: Contains layout templates for different sections.
  - `assets/`: Contains CSS, JavaScript, and other static assets.
- `project/`: Contains project documentation and context.
  - `CONTEXT.md`: Project context document.

## Key Features
- **Experiments**: Showcases mini-experiments with detailed descriptions and links to external repositories.
- **Blog**: A section for sharing thoughts and insights, organized by tags.
- **Profile**: A professional introduction and details about the user.

## Final Decisions
- **Content Management**: All content is managed using Markdown files. This includes experiments, blog posts (now referred to as "thoughts"), and profile information.
- **Automatic Listing**: Jekyll/Liquid templates are used to automatically list experiments and thoughts, eliminating the need for separate JSON files like `blog.json` and `projects.json`.
- **Naming Conventions**: The "Blog" section has been renamed to "Thoughts" to reflect a more casual sharing of personal insights.
- **Dummy Placeholders**: Sample experiments and thoughts are marked as dummy placeholders generated by AI to indicate their nature.
- **Maintenance**: The website is designed for minimal maintenance, with content updates made through Markdown files.
- **Future Development**: Plans include adding new experiments and thoughts as they are developed and exploring additional features to enhance user experience.

## Maintenance
- Experiments and thoughts are maintained using Markdown files, simplifying content management and allowing for rich content directly in the files.
- The website is designed to be easily maintainable with minimal manual updates required.
- All content updates must be made in the `docs/` directory to ensure they are published to GitHub Pages.

## Future Plans
- Continue to add new experiments and thoughts as they are developed.
- Explore additional features or improvements to enhance user experience.
