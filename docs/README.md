## Final Decisions
- **Content Management**: All content is managed using Markdown files. This includes projects, blog posts (now referred to as "thoughts"), and profile information.
- **Automatic Listing**: Jekyll/Liquid templates are used to automatically list projects and thoughts, eliminating the need for separate JSON files like `blog.json` and `projects.json`.
- **Naming Conventions**: The "Blog" section has been renamed to "Thoughts" to reflect a more casual sharing of personal insights.
- **Dummy Placeholders**: Sample projects and thoughts are marked as dummy placeholders generated by AI to indicate their nature.

- **Future Development**: Plans include adding new projects and thoughts as they are developed and exploring additional features to enhance user experience.

## Maintenance
