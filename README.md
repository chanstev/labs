# Labs Landing Page

## Overview
This repository contains a static website for labs.chansteven.com, focusing on a lightweight landing page hosted on GitHub Pages. The website showcases mini-projects, a blog, and a profile page, with an emphasis on minimal maintenance.

## Methodology
This repository was co-created using Cursor, an AI-powered coding assistant. The development process involved the following steps:

1. **Project Context Document**: The initial step was to build a comprehensive project context document (`project/CONTEXT.md`) that outlines the project's structure, key features, and maintenance strategies.

2. **Initial Version Generation**: Using the project context document, the initial version of the website was generated. This included creating the necessary files and directories, such as the landing page, project and blog post Markdown files, and layout templates.

3. **Iterative Development**: The development process was iterative, with continuous feedback and approval from a human developer. This ensured that the generated content met the desired standards and requirements.

4. **AI-Generated Content**: All content, including projects and blog posts, was generated by AI but required human approval to ensure accuracy and relevance.

5. **Final Decisions**: The final decisions regarding content management, automatic listing, naming conventions, and future development plans were documented in the project context document.

## Value of Project Context Document
The project context document serves as a guiding principle for AI collaboration by providing a clear and structured overview of the project. It ensures that all stakeholders, including AI, have a consistent understanding of the project's goals, structure, and maintenance strategies. This document acts as a reference point for generating content and making decisions, facilitating efficient and effective collaboration between human developers and AI.

## Project Structure
- `docs/`: Contains the main content of the website (GitHub Pages source)
- `project/`: Contains project documentation and context, serving as a collaboration space between AI and human developers
  - `CONTEXT.md`: Project context document that guides AI-human collaboration
