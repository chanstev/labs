# Labs

A personal website showcasing experiments and thoughts, built through AI collaboration.

## About This Project

This repository is itself an experiment in AI-assisted development. It demonstrates how AI can help create and maintain a personal website through natural language conversations, focusing on:

- **Iterative Development**: The site evolved through continuous dialogue and refinement
- **Natural Language to Code**: Features were implemented through conversational instructions
- **Documentation as Dialogue**: Project context was developed through ongoing conversation

## Methodology

The development process followed a structured approach centered around the project context document:

1. **Project Context First**: Started with a comprehensive project context document (`project/CONTEXT.md`) that outlines:
   - Project structure and organization
   - Key features and requirements
   - Maintenance strategies
   - Future development plans

2. **Context-Driven Development**: Used the context document as a single source of truth for:
   - Making architectural decisions
   - Guiding implementation details
   - Maintaining consistency across the project
   - Facilitating AI-human collaboration

3. **Iterative Refinement**: The context document evolved through:
   - Continuous dialogue between AI and human
   - Regular updates as decisions were made
   - Documentation of key architectural choices
   - Recording of maintenance strategies
